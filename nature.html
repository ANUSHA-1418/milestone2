<h1 style="color:black;text-allign:left;font-size:80;"><big><u>BEAUTY OF NATURE</big></u></h1>
<pre>
<p style="color:blue;text-align:left;font-size:15"> Nature is beauty and beauty is Nature.
 Everywhere Nature is beautiful in one way or the other. 
The beauty of Nature has been a source of inspiration and delight to mankind.
 It is an endless source of joy. 
Dew drops on the green grass look like pearls.
 Sunrise is a lovely scene of Nature.
 Setting Sun, starry night,
 silvery light of the Moon, 
snow-covered mountains, deep and dark forests,
 scent and fragrance of flowers are some of the beauties of Nature. 
The chirping of birds in trees has a music of its own.
 In Spring, Nature is at her best. 
Blooming flowers of different hues fill the air with fragrance.
 The beauties of Nature soothe our eyes,
 gladden our hearts and ennoble our souls.</p>

<pre>
<p style="color:blue;text-align:centre;font-size:15">Nature is the most divine creation of god around us
, it is considered an integral part of mankind.
 Nature has bestowed us with water, air,
 plants and much more to make us survive on this planet.
 But are we paying back to our mother nature?
 The answer is no as we have not only failed in paying back 
but also exploited nature to a great extent.</p></pre>
